# Data_sturcture_algorithms
This is personal practice and learning on data structure and algorithms implemented with Python 3. I comment the code with detail explanation and my understanding for reviewing.
- *todo means that does not include in the reference book but I think which is necessary and related to the content in each chapter and I will supplement such parts one by one.*
