# Data_sturcture_algorithms
This is personal practice and learning on data structure and algorithms implemented with Python 3.

The reference book is <*Problems Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures Using Python(Second Edition)*>.

Until now I have updated the linear sturcture including  queue, stack, orderlist, unorderlist.
